## Introduction
This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of my website, HotBeansWeb. In this readme, I will present detailed descriptions of my webpage designs, explaining the rationale behind my design choices and the specific features implemented. Additionally, I will outline the testing procedures conducted to ensure the website functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. Based on the constructive feedback I have received from users, I will also discuss various optimisations I plan to implement to enhance the overall user experience and performance of the site.

## Design Documentation
### Client requirements analysis
HotBeansWeb envisions the development of a dynamic new section on their website that focuses on attracting talented web developers. This dedicated segment will specifically target individuals who have successfully completed formal web development training or possess relevant qualifications and are actively seeking employment within the industry.

## Development Justification
### Plan to Meet the Requirements
#### Company Profile:
**Content Gathering:** Collect comprehensive information about HotBeansWeb, emphasising its historical background, core values, organisational culture, and current focus areas. This should include insights into its founding, significant milestones, and how its mission has evolved over time. 

**Design:** The website section dedicated to the company's profile will feature a clean and modern layout. It should prominently showcase a professional image of either the office space or a team photograph to create a personal connection. Accompanying this visual will be succinct yet impactful text summarising the company's history, articulating its mission statement, and outlining its vision for the future.

#### Profiles of Trainee Web Developers:
**Content Gathering:** Initiate contact with current trainee web developers to compile detailed profiles that tell their unique stories. This could include personal anecdotes, a short biography, educational backgrounds, key skills they possess, and narratives about their professional growth and experiences at HotBeansWeb.

**Design:** A user-friendly grid or card-style layout will be employed to display each developer's profile. Each card will feature a profile picture alongside a brief description that highlights the individual’s journey, skills, and contributions to the company.

#### Job Specifications and Required Qualifications:
**Content:** I will curate a thorough list of job specifications tailored to open positions at HotBeansWeb. This will encompass a breakdown of technical skills, soft skills, requisite experience levels, and educational qualifications that the candidates should possess.

**Design:** The job listings will be presented in a clear and easy-to-read format, allowing for efficient navigation. Each role will be categorised with relevant tags, enabling users to filter job postings based on their qualifications or interests, thus ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

#### Online Application Form:
**Content:** I will design an intuitive online application form aimed at enhancing the applicant's experience. This form will include essential fields for:  
  * Personal Information (such as full name, contact number, and email address)  
  * Education and Qualifications (degree(s) obtained and institutions attended)  
  * Portfolio Link (a hyperlink to their previous work)  
  * Resume Upload (a field to upload their CV)  
  * Cover Letter Section (where they can express their motivations for applying)  

**Validation:** To ensure a high-quality submission process, I’ll implement form validation measures to automatically check for completeness and accuracy of the entered information, prompting users to correct any discrepancies before submission.

#### Links to Web Development Courses:
**Content Gathering:** I will research and identify reputable online platforms offering web development courses, such as Coursera, Codecademy, and others. The focus will be on courses that align with the specific skills and competencies that HotBeansWeb seeks in candidates.

**Design:** Each course will be presented in an individual card format, containing a brief overview that outlines the primary topics covered and the skills acquired upon completion. Each card will also include a direct link that redirects users to the course's detailed page for further exploration and enrollment.

### Wireframe:
The wireframe acts as a framework of the website, where I can focus on webpage structure and functionality as opposed to colours and the overall style of the website.

### Mockups
The mockups are built to look like the website in it's final form - in a static, high quality image. The mockups help to visualise the final design before coding begins.

### Flow Diagram
I have also designed a flow diagram that dictates how users will traverse the webpage.

### Colour schemes and Typography
I opted to use the colours from the logo to come up with an appropriate colour scheme, this was done to maintain brand identity. The same colour palette is used throughout the website for a unified look. I also decided to use gradients like the one in the logo to add some flair to the website and on the interactive elements so that they stand out to the users and have a direct call to action.

## Evaluation and improvements
### Evaluation of Design & Optimised website against client requirements

This evaluation assesses the final website against the client's requirements, which included: a profile of the company, profiles of existing trainee developers, job specifications and required qualifications, an online applciation form and external links to web development courses. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether the website effectively meets these goals in terms of design, functionality, usablilty and performance.

The evaluation process involved a detailed review of each section of the website, functionality testting across multiple devices and browsers, user experience analysis and performance testing using tools such as webpagetest.org (which has various testing tools including Google Lighthouse and a comprehensive site performance test). A basic test plan was used to ensure each feature was tested methodically, and any bugs or issues were recorded and fixed. This evaluation will cover the website's strengths, weaknesses and any potential future improvements that can be made to the website.
