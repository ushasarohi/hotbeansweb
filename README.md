## Introduction
This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of my website, HotBeansWeb. In this readme, I will present detailed descriptions of my webpage designs, explaining the rationale behind my design choices and the specific features implemented. Additionally, I will outline the testing procedures conducted to ensure the website functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. Based on the constructive feedback I have received from users, I will also discuss various optimisations I plan to implement to enhance the overall user experience and performance of the site.
