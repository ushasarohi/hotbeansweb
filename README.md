## Development Justification
**Plan to Meet the Requirements**

**Company Profile**  
*Content Gathering:* Collect comprehensive information about HotBeansWeb, emphasizing its historical background, core values, organizational culture, and current focus areas. This should include insights into its founding, significant milestones, and how its mission has evolved over time. 

*Design:* The website section dedicated to the company's profile will feature a clean and modern layout. It should prominently showcase a professional image of either the office space or a team photograph to create a personal connection. Accompanying this visual will be succinct yet impactful text summarizing the company's history, articulating its mission statement, and outlining its vision for the future.

**Profiles of Trainee Web Developers**  
*Content Gathering:* Initiate contact with current trainee web developers to compile detailed profiles that tell their unique stories. This could include personal anecdotes, a short biography, educational backgrounds, key skills they possess, and narratives about their professional growth and experiences at HotBeansWeb.

*Design:* A user-friendly grid or card-style layout will be employed to display each developer's profile. Each card will feature a profile picture alongside a brief description that highlights the individual’s journey, skills, and contributions to the company.

**Job Specifications and Required Qualifications**  
*Content:* I will curate a thorough list of job specifications tailored to open positions at HotBeansWeb. This will encompass a breakdown of technical skills, soft skills, requisite experience levels, and educational qualifications that the candidates should possess.

*Design:* The job listings will be presented in a clear and easy-to-read format, allowing for efficient navigation. Each role will be categorized with relevant tags, enabling users to filter job postings based on their qualifications or interests, thus ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

**Online Application Form**  
*Content:* I will design an intuitive online application form aimed at enhancing the applicant's experience. This form will include essential fields for:

- Portfolio Link (a hyperlink to their previous work)

*Validation:* To ensure a high-quality submission process, I’ll implement form validation measures to automatically check for completeness and accuracy of the entered information, prompting users to correct any discrepancies before submission.

Each card will also include a direct link that redirects users to the course's detailed page for further exploration and enrollment.
